// Oh no! Ghosts have reportedly swarmed the city. It's your job to get rid of them and save the day!

// In this kata, strings represent buildings while whitespaces within those strings represent ghosts.

// So what are you waiting for? Return the building(string) without any ghosts(whitespaces)!

// Example:

// ghostBusters("Sky scra per");
// Should return:

// "Skyscraper"
// If the building contains no ghosts, return the string:

// "You just wanted my autograph didn't you?"

// describe("Tests", () => {
//     it("test", () => {
//   Test.expect(ghostBusters("Factor y") === "Factory", 'Nope, there may still be a ghost in the building. Try again.');
//   Test.expect(ghostBusters("O  f fi ce") === "Office", 'Nope, there may still be a ghost in the building. Try again.');
//   Test.expect(ghostBusters("BusStation") === "You just wanted my autograph didn't you?", 'Nope, as there were no ghosts in the BusStation you need to return a witty retort.');
//     });
//   });
