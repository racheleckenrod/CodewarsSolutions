// The national go-kart racing competition is taking place in your local town and you've been called for building the winners podium with the available wooden blocks. Thankfully you are in a wood-rich area, number of blocks are always at least 6.

// Remember a classic racing podium have three platforms for first, second and third places. First place is the highest and second place is higher than third. Also notice that platforms are arranged as 2nd - 1st - 3rd.

// The organizers want a podium that satisfies:

// The first place platform has the minimum height posible
// The second place platform has the closest height to first place
// All platforms have heights greater than zero.
// Task
// Given the numbers of blocks available, return an array / tuple or another data structure depending on the language (refer sample tests) with the heights of 2nd, 1st, 3rd places platforms.

// Examples (input -> output)
// 11 ->   [4, 5, 2]
// 6  ->   [2, 3, 1]
// 10 ->   [4, 5, 1]

// describe("Tests", function() {
//     it("Fixed tests", function() {
//       dotest(11, [4, 5, 2]);
//       dotest(6, [2, 3, 1]);
//       dotest(10, [4, 5, 1]);
//       dotest(100000, [33334, 33335, 33331]);
//       dotest(7, [2, 4, 1]);
//       dotest(8, [3, 4, 1]);
//     });
//   });

// I might as well try PREP seeing as though I have been working on this problem for probably a couple of hours to incorrect solutions and a stand still as to what to try next.
// Parameters:
// we are given n, a number greater than 6 for the number of blocks to build a three level podium
// Results:
// we are to return an array of three numbers [second, first, third]
// number of blocks. third (and al of them ) must be at least one. First is to be the shortest possible and second is to be closest to first as possible.
// There is an example in the test cases given of 100000 = n, and first is 33335, second 33334 and third is 33331. that shows me that there should be some sort of diving by three and most likely subtraction. I was athinking that there would be a modulus situation that would give differing proportions depending on what the remainder was, but I have not found what that might be.   
// if first second and third correspond to a,b,c 

// a + b + c = n 
// none of the letters can be zero. 
// n >= 6
// a must be > b and b > c.
// n = 6  b = 2, a = 3, c = 1

//   Well I spent I ton of time on this problem and ended up finding a video that had the 7 solution to just return what they were expecting for 7 and then when I did that the rest of my code worked as well 

// WOW, a major bit frustrating but glad I stuck with it honestly I almost looked at the solution....

// Here's another good solution that takes into account another problem I was having... 
// function racePodium(blocks) {
//     let first = Math.ceil(blocks/3)+1;
//     let second = first - 1;
//     let third = blocks-first-second;
//     if (third == 0) {
//       third = 1
//       second -= 1
//     }
//     return [second,first,third]
//   }

// I really thought there was some complicated formula that I wasn't able to see, and there is not...
