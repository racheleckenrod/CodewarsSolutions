// John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

// John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

// Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

// Task
// Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

// Example:
// wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"

// wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"

// Notes:
// all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge

// 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that w * h * l is zero

// the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

// FORTH: the number of rolls will be a positive or null integer (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)

// In Javascript English numbers are preloaded and can be accessed as:

// numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve","thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen", "twenty"]
// For other languages it is not preloaded but you can use the above one if you need it.

// describe("wallpaper",function() {
//     it("Basic tests",function() { 
//         testing(wallpaper(6.3, 4.5, 3.29), "sixteen");71.064
//         testing(wallpaper(7.8, 2.9, 3.29), "sixteen");
//         testing(wallpaper(6.3, 5.8, 3.13), "seventeen");
//         testing(wallpaper(6.1, 6.7, 2.81), "sixteen");
//     })})

// PREP
// Parameters:
// given length width and height in meters of a room to wallpaper
// Results:
// are to return in lowercase english word the numbr of rolls of wallpaper.
// rolls are .52 meters wide and 10 meters long. we need 15% more than needed
// to calculate the sq meters and not the volume, we add l*H*2 + w*h*2
// then divide by .52 and divide by 10 and multiply by 1.15% and round up 

function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
    let x = Math.ceil(((((2*((l*h) + (w*h)))/.52)/10) * 1.15))
    return numbers[x]
}
console.log(wallpaper(6.1, 6.7, 2.81))
