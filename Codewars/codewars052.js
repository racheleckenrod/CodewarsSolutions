// Implement a function which multiplies two numbers.


// Write here your multiply-function

function multiply(a,b){
    return a * b
}

// somehow I was supposed to know that the function was supposed to be named "multiply"... I guess I had better start looking at the tests more carefully if I want to get more first tries..
