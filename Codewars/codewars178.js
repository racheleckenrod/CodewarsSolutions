// It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

// Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.

// If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.

// Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "£" (= "\u00A3", JS, Go, Java and Julia), "$" (C#, C++, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP, Python, Haskell and Lua) or "¥" (Rust).

function bonusTime(salary, bonus) {
    // your code here
    return bonus ? "\u00A3" + 10*salary : "\u00A3" + salary
    }

    // woo-hoo got this on the second try... didn't use a return with the ternary, but I did get the ternary part correct... progress!!
