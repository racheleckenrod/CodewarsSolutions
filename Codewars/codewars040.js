// Variable assignment
// Fix the variables assigments so that this code stores the string 'devLab' in the variable name.

var a = "dev"
var b = "Lab"

let = name 
name = a + b

// looks like I may have just gotten luck here, as I wasn't aware of the issues with the term "name" and it's depricatoin.
