// This function should test if the factor is a factor of base.

// Return true if it is a factor or false if it is not.

function checkForFactor (base, factor) {
  return(base % factor===0)
  }

//   tried to use if base % factor === 0 return true, and else 
// false, but that didn't work. This version makes more sense to me too.
